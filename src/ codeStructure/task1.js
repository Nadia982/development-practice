// I wrote the code below on one line, but VS Code automatically put it on multiple lines

console.log(first);
/*some comment*/ console.log(second);
/*another comment*/ console.log(third);

// Create a file task1.js in src/codeStructure. This file is for the solution of a task bellow

// Implement these requirements in one line of code:

// Log to the console 3 words: first, second, and third

// Use console.log for every word (3 times)

// Add a comment between first and second words printing (comment is: some comment)

// Add a comment between second and third words printing (comment is: another comment)
